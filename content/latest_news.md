# Unreliable Rankings: How Removing a Fraction of Crowdsourced Data Can Significantly Alter the Results of LLM Ranking Platforms

> * LLM ranking platforms, which evaluate and compare the performance of Large Language Models, can have skewed results due to a small fraction of influential data points.
* The rankings on these platforms can be highly fragile and change significantly with the removal of just a few data points, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation strategies.
* To improve platform stability, potential solutions include collecting more detailed feedback data, using more robust ranking systems, and evaluating the robustness of LLM ranking systems to dropping a small fraction of evaluation data.



**LLM ranking platforms are online systems that evaluate and compare the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on crowdsourced data, but their results can be skewed by a small fraction of influential data points.** 
These platforms use various ranking systems, such as the Bradley-Terry ranking system, to determine which LLMs perform best in real-world situations. However, research has shown that removing just a tiny fraction of the crowdsourced data can significantly change the results, raising questions about the reliability of these rankings.

The process of LLM ranking platforms involves collecting data from users, who evaluate and compare the performance of different LLMs on various tasks. The data is then used to generate rankings, which are often used by developers and researchers to determine the best LLM for a particular application. Some key features of LLM ranking platforms include:
* Crowdsourced data collection
* Evaluation of LLMs on various tasks
* Generation of rankings based on user feedback
* Comparison of LLM performance in real-world situations

Researchers at MIT and IBM Research have demonstrated that the rankings on popular LLM evaluation platforms, such as LMArena, are highly fragile and can be changed by removing just a few data points. For example, removing 2 out of 57,477 user reviews was enough to change which model held the top spot. This highlights the need for more rigorous strategies to evaluate model rankings and improve platform stability.

To address this issue, researchers have proposed a method for evaluating the robustness of LLM ranking systems to dropping a small fraction of evaluation data. This approach is computationally fast and easy to adopt, and can help determine whether a ranking platform is susceptible to this problem. Some potential solutions to improve platform stability include:
1. Collecting more detailed feedback data to generate rankings
2. Using more robust ranking systems that are less sensitive to influential data points
3. Implementing mechanisms to detect and mitigate the impact of biased or noisy data

The study's findings have significant implications for the AI industry, which relies heavily on crowdsourced benchmarks to evaluate LLM performance. As one researcher noted, "At the end of the day, a user wants to know whether they are choosing the best LLM. If only a few prompts are driving this ranking, that suggests the ranking might not be the end-all-be-all." By developing more robust and reliable ranking systems, researchers can provide more accurate and trustworthy evaluations of LLM performance, which can help drive progress in the field of natural language processing.

**A small fraction of crowdsourced data can significantly impact LLM rankings, with as few as 2 out of 57,477 user reviews being enough to change the top-ranked model.** 
The impact of a small fraction of crowdsourced data on LLM rankings is a significant concern, as it can lead to unreliable reports on which model performs best in real situations. Researchers at MIT and IBM Research have demonstrated the fragility of LLM evaluation platforms, such as LMArena, where removing a tiny fraction of data can alter the rankings. 

The study reveals that the Bradley-Terry ranking system, a widely used LLM ranking system, is susceptible to this problem, and a fast method has been developed to test ranking platforms and determine their robustness. Key findings include:
* Removing a tiny fraction of crowdsourced data can change which models are top-ranked
* The Bradley-Terry ranking system is vulnerable to this issue
* A fast method has been developed to test ranking platforms and determine their susceptibility

The implications of this study are significant, as it raises questions about the weight that should be given to crowdsourced benchmarks in the AI industry. According to Broderick, "a user wants to know whether they are choosing the best LLM, and if only a few prompts are driving this ranking, that suggests the ranking might not be the end-all-be-all." 

To address this issue, researchers suggest collecting more detailed feedback data to generate rankings, which can help improve platform stability. The study highlights the need for more rigorous strategies to evaluate model rankings, and the developed method can be used to test ranking platforms and identify influential data points. 

Some potential solutions to this problem include:
1. Collecting more detailed feedback data to generate rankings
2. Using more robust ranking systems that are less susceptible to small changes in data
3. Implementing methods to identify and mitigate the impact of influential data points. 

The study's findings have significant implications for the AI industry, and further research is needed to develop more robust and reliable methods for evaluating LLM rankings. By understanding the impact of small fractions of crowdsourced data on LLM rankings, developers can create more effective and reliable models that meet the needs of users. 

In conclusion, the impact of a small fraction of crowdsourced data on LLM rankings is a significant concern that needs to be addressed. By developing more robust ranking systems and collecting more detailed feedback data, the AI industry can create more reliable and effective models that meet the needs of users. **The study's findings highlight the need for more rigorous strategies to evaluate model rankings and the importance of considering the potential impact of small changes in data on LLM rankings.**

**Researchers have developed methods to test the robustness of LLM ranking systems, including a fast and easy-to-adopt approach to evaluate the Bradley-Terry ranking system's susceptibility to data removal.** These methods aim to identify influential data points that can significantly impact model rankings. By applying such methods to popular human-preference platforms, researchers can determine whether the rankings are reliable or prone to changes with minimal data removal.

To address the issue of fragile rankings, researchers have proposed the following approaches:
* Evaluating the robustness of the Bradley-Terry ranking system to dropping a small fraction of evaluation data
* Developing a fast method to test ranking platforms and determine their susceptibility to data removal
* Collecting more detailed feedback data to generate rankings and improve platform stability
* Identifying influential data points that drive the rankings, to ensure that the rankings are not driven by just a few prompts.

The need for robust ranking systems is highlighted by the fact that removing just a tiny fraction of crowdsourced data can change which models are top-ranked. **This raises questions about the reliability of crowdsourced benchmarks and the weight that should be put on them in the AI industry.** Researchers have demonstrated that popular LLM evaluation platforms like LMArena are highly fragile, with removing just 2 out of 57,477 user reviews enough to change which model holds the top spot.

The developed methods can help to identify whether a ranking platform is susceptible to this problem, allowing for more informed decisions about the choice of LLM. **By applying these methods, users can determine whether the ranking is reliable or if it is driven by just a few influential data points.** This is crucial, as a user wants to know whether they are choosing the best LLM, and a ranking driven by just a few prompts may not be the end-all-be-all.

In addition to the proposed approaches, researchers have also suggested that collecting more detailed feedback data can help to improve platform stability. **This can include collecting data on the specific strengths and weaknesses of each model, as well as the context in which they are being used.** By taking a more nuanced approach to evaluating LLMs, users can make more informed decisions about which model to choose, and developers can focus on improving the areas where their models are weakest.

Overall, the development of methods to test the robustness of LLM ranking systems is an important step towards ensuring that these systems are reliable and trustworthy. **By identifying influential data points and developing more robust evaluation methods, researchers can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of LLM rankings.** This, in turn, can help to drive the development of more effective and efficient LLMs, and can ultimately benefit a wide range of applications and industries.
